 <li>Let G be a color graph where each node has a color and multiple nodescan share the same color. In particular, there is a designated initial node. An <em>ω</em>-path is an infinite walk on G that starts from the initial.</li>

 <li>Let G be a color graph where each node has a color and multiple nodescan share the same color. In particular, there is a designated initial node. An <em>ω</em>-path is an infinite walk on G that starts from the initial. Design an algoirthm to decide whether there is an <em>ω</em>-path on which it passes red nodes for infinitely many times and passes blue nodes for only finitely many times.</li>

 <li>Let G be a color graph where each node has a color and multiple nodescan share the same color. In particular, there is a designated initial node. An <em>ω</em>-path is an infinite walk on G that starts from the initial. A good <em>ω</em>path is is one where there are infinitely many prefixes, each of which satisfies the following condition: the number of red nodes equals the number of blue nodes. Design an algoirthm to decide whether there is a good <em>ω</em>-path.</li>

 <li>Let G be a color graph where each node has a color and multiple nodescan share the same color. In particular, there is a designated initial node. An <em>ω</em>-path is an infinite walk on G that starts from the initial. A bad <em>ω</em>-path is is one where there are infinitely many prefixes, each of which satisfies the following condition: the number of red nodes is a multiple of 5. Design an algoirthm to decide whether there is a bad <em>ω</em>-path.</li>
